1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crm-pro.git
cd crm-pro
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up Supabase**
- Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- Get your Project URL and Anon Key from Project Settings → API
- Update `crm-system.jsx` lines 66-67 with your credentials:

const supabase = createClient(
  'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',      // Replace with your Project URL
  'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'  // Replace with your Anon Key
);
```

4. **Create database tables**

Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Leads table
CREATE TABLE leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  company TEXT,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  source TEXT,
  stage TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
  notes JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  reminders JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  quote_items JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Meetings table
CREATE TABLE meetings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  date_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Activities table
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE meetings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE activities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own leads" ON leads
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own leads" ON leads
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own leads" ON leads
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own leads" ON leads
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own meetings" ON meetings
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own meetings" ON meetings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own meetings" ON meetings
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own meetings" ON meetings
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own activities" ON activities

- ✅ Company provided: +5 points
- ✅ Premium source (Referral/LinkedIn/Partner): +15 points
- ✅ Each note added: +5 points
- ✅ Qualified stage: +10 points
- ✅ Proposal stage: +20 points

**Score Categories:**
- 🔥 **Hot (60-100)**: High priority, ready to close
- ☀️ **Warm (30-59)**: Engaged, needs nurturing
- ❄️ **Cold (0-29)**: Low engagement, long-term prospect
